## Session: 06/23/2026 — UI polish, shared HUD, flicker fix

### ~05:30 ET — Activity feed repositioned + text readability + agent page navigation
| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| Activity feed relocated | Moved from bottom-center (overlapping "TAP OR SAY RAMBO") to fixed bottom-right | 
| Command input relocated | Moved to fixed bottom-left, no longer overlapping the orb |
| Removed splash footer | Eliminated the `<footer>` wrapper that caused scrolling on the splash screen |
| Agent page text readability | Boosted opacity on dim text: `.ap-agent-role` 0.5→0.75, `.ap-agent-desc` 0.55→0.8, `.ap-obj-text` 0.7→0.85, `.ap-param-key` 0.4→0.65, `.ap-qs-name` 0.5→0.7. Added dark `text-shadow` for contrast against the bright orb |
| Agent page nav expanded | Added Learning Log and Round Table buttons to the quick-switch bar with a gold divider |

### ~05:45 ET — Learning Log complete redesign
| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| Layout overhaul | Removed scrollable center content; now `height: 100vh; overflow: hidden` (single screen, no scroll) |
| Side panel architecture | Left panel: System Identity + Operational Learning stats. Right panel: Recent Learnings list |
| SVG branch connections | Bezier curves connecting orb outer ring to both side panels with animated pulse dots |
| Glass-morph panels | Matching agent page aesthetic: `backdrop-filter: blur(14px)`, semi-transparent borders |
| Route fix | Fixed mismatch: AgentPage navigated to `/learning-log` but route was `/learning` |

### ~06:00 ET — Flicker mitigation (3 fixes)
| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| `Vector2` hoisting | Replaced per-render `new Vector2()` allocations in ChromaticAberration with a hoisted `CHROMA_OFFSET` constant across all 4 page components |
| Animation removal | Removed infinite `responseFloat`/`apResponseFloat` CSS animations on `backdrop-filter` panels (GPU recomposite every frame) |
| GPU hints | Added `will-change: contents` on orb canvas containers, `powerPreference: 'high-performance'` and `stencil: false` on all WebGL contexts |

### ~06:15 ET — Shared HUD system + ChromaticAberration removal + nav bar on Learning Log
| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| **SharedHUD module** | Created `SharedHUD.js` + `SharedHUD.css` — extracted reusable `StatBars`, `ActivityFeed`, `CommandInput` components and `useSystemStats`/`useActivityFeed` hooks |
| **CPU/RAM/DSK stat bars** | Restored on every page (top-left under "BY DANIEL") — previously lost when footer was removed |
| **LIVE command input** | Added to every agent page, Learning Log, and Round Table (bottom-left) |
| **Activity feed** | Added to every agent page, Learning Log, and Round Table (bottom-right) |
| **ChromaticAberration removed** | Stripped from all 4 pages (SplashScreen, AgentPage, LearningLog, RoundTable) as a flicker test — the RGB color fringing effect was a suspected source of persistent screen flickers |
| **Agent nav bar on Learning Log** | Added the full quick-switch agent navigation bar to the Learning Log page with "Log" highlighted as active |

### Voice Latency Optimization (06/23/2026)
| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Streaming LLM responses — `messages.stream()` replaces blocking `messages.create()` in `_speak()` | Done |
| Per-sentence splitting — regex sentence splitter with abbreviation handling (`_split_sentence()`) | Done |
| Hold-one-ahead pattern — flags `is_final` on last segment without extra round-trip | Done |
| `speak_segment` WebSocket events — `base_turn_id`, `seq`, `is_final` broadcast to client | Done |
| Client segment queue — `pumpQueue()` chains `speechSynthesis.speak()` per sentence | Done |
| VAD silence timer reduced 1500ms → 1000ms | Done |
| 800ms artificial command delay removed | Done |
| 7 streaming tests + full suite (22/22 → 61/61 passing) | Done |

### Cost Dashboard (06/23/2026)
| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — Pricing module: `MODEL_PRICING` table, `compute_cost()` with longest-prefix matching | Done |
| **Phase 2** — Storage: `usage` SQLite table via `aiosqlite`, `UsageRepo` with `record()` + `usage_since()` | Done |
| **Phase 3** — Capture: `record_usage()` best-effort helper wired into `_speak()` streaming path, catch-all wrapper | Done |
| **Phase 4** — Aggregation: `GET /usage` endpoint, MTD/today/per-model/daily/cache-savings/MoM, 60s cache | Done |
| **Phase 5** — UI: `CostIndicator` component mirroring `StatBars`, click-to-expand panel on all 4 pages | Done |
| 34 new tests (pricing: 11, repo: 7, capture: 6, dashboard: 10) — 95/95 total passing | Done |

### Self-Knowledge System (06/23/2026)
| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1** — Doc scaffold (`context/self/rambo.md`) + block parser with AUTO markers | Done |
| **Phase 2** — 5 introspecting generators (capabilities, subagents, integrations, voice, recent activity) reading from live registries | Done |
| **Phase 3** — Drift checker scanning hand-written sections for stale file/symbol refs + CLI (`--render`, `--refresh`, `--check`, `--check --strict`) + allowlist | Done |
| **Phase 4** — Pre-commit hook auto-refreshes self-knowledge doc + idempotent installer script | Done |
| **Phase 5** — Slim summary (~291 tokens) injected into system prompt via `build_system_prompt()`, controlled by `RAMBO_SELF_KNOWLEDGE` env var (slim/full/off) | Done |

### Factory — Sub-Agent Spawner (06/23/2026)
| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| **Tier 0** — SQLite tables (`spawn_tasks`, `spawned_agents`, `research_reports`) with state-machine transitions, daily cap (5/day), reserved slugs (13), slug uniqueness; `ToolRegistry` with `factory_allowed` gating + 5 starter tools | Done |
| **Tier 1** — Research subagent: `web_search` loop, forced `emit_skills_report` on final iteration, 24h cache, Pydantic-validated `SkillsReport` | Done |
| **Tier 2** — Spec markdown writer (`agent-specs/<slug>.md`) + system-prompt generator with prompt-injection sanitization + revision support | Done |
| **Tier 3** — `SpawnPipeline` state machine (PENDING → AWAITING_APPROVAL), always lands terminal, reserved/duplicate slug + injection guards | Done |
| **Tier 4** — Approval gate: approve creates agent + notifies registry; reject-with-feedback re-runs prompt gen (capped 3 rounds); `GET /factory/pending` page-load hydration | Done |
| **Tier 5** — `ConfigDrivenAgent` (one generic tool-use loop, zero per-agent code) + `RegistryWatcher` (30s poll + immediate refresh on approve) registering `dispatch_to_<slug>` | Done |
| **Frontend** — `FactoryDock` + `useFactoryPending` in SharedHUD, approve/reject/revise cards keyed by task_id, mounted on **all pages** (Splash, Agent, Learning Log, Round Table) | Done |
| **Dispatch** — `Orchestrator._dispatch_spawned()` matches a goal to a spawned agent by slug/name and runs its `ConfigDrivenAgent`; wired before core orchestration in `handle()` | Done |
| API: `POST /factory/spawn`, `GET /factory/pending`, `GET /factory/task/{id}`, approve/reject/agents endpoints; strong refs on in-flight pipeline tasks | Done |
| 59 backend tests (repo: 14, registry: 6, research: 6, spec: 7, pipeline: 5, approval: 8, config/watcher: 8, dispatch: 5) — 154/154 total passing | Done |

## What's Next

### Short Term (this week)
| Feature | Priority |
|---|---|
| Live voice testing — configure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and measure new latency floor | High |
| VAD tuning — adjust silence timer after measuring streaming latency | High |
| Evaluate flicker results — if ChromaticAberration removal fixes flickers, keep it removed; if not, investigate further | Medium |
| Operator greeting sequence — personalized boot message | Medium |
| Shutdown / logout sequence | Medium |
| Task history panel — scrollable log of past executions with timestamps | Medium |

### Mid Term (next 2 weeks)
| Feature | Priority |
|---|---|
| Sub-agent independent LLM calls — give each agent its own `messages.stream()` with per-agent `source` label for cost tracking (`ConfigDrivenAgent` now does this for Factory-spawned agents; extend to the 10 hand-rolled specialists) | High |
| Factory follow-ups — ~~mount `FactoryDock` on all pages~~ ✓, ~~wire dispatch into orchestrator~~ ✓; remaining: surface tool-wishlist as a build backlog, capture `record_usage(source=...)` inside `ConfigDrivenAgent`, multi-task spawn matching when a goal names two agents | Medium |
| Alembic migration framework — versioned schema management as DB tables grow (now 2 DBs: `usage.db`, `factory.db`) | Medium |
| Color presets / theme switcher | Medium |
| Modular HUD panel system (drag, resize, dock) | Medium |
| Mission dashboard — aggregated stats across all agents | Medium |
| Data stream visualizer — live data flowing through agent pipeline | Low |
| Mobile responsive layout | Medium |

### Long Term
| Feature | Priority |
|---|---|
| Secure login / operator authentication | High |
| CLI companion tool (`rambo` command) | Medium |
| Plugin system for custom agents | Medium |
| Multi-operator support | Low |
| Real-time collaboration view | Low |
